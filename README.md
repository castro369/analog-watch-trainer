# Analog Watch Trainer

## About ðŸ“š
-------

Analog Watch Trainer is your go-to tool for mastering reading time on traditional analog watches.

## Usage
-------
The repository can be cloned and the file `index.html` can be opened on a browser. But if you are like me and love containers, then just build an image from the Dockerfile and access it from a browser. 

```
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t my-website .

# Run a container from the image
docker run -d -p 80:80 my-website
```
